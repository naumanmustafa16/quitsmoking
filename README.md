The time of my last cigarette is 16:23. 
To make my journey at TOP, I will make practical use of the knowledge that I have earned so far. 
I will build a clock which will start at 16:23 on 14th July-2024 and will work upto 16:23 till 21-July-2024. Within these 7 days, I will not smoke. In this period, my body will get de-toxified and I will become Non-Smoker again.
It will count two times: 1) TIme elapsed since last smoke & 2) Time remaining.
